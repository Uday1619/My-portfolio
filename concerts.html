    <p>Wellâ€¦ in certain faculties it was, despite the fact that the guitar-like instrument made 3,500 years back
         (that's a vintage guitar!) is a long way from the guitars we play today.It had a place with an artist of
          the time known as Har-Mose and was produced using cleaned  cedar with a rawhide soundboard, included
